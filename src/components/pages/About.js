        I began my web development journey on September 13th, 2021 by way of the University of Washington's coding bootcamp. I have learned a range of fullstack programming skills including React, which was used in creating this portfolio. I have learned skills in data base building including MySQL and MongoDB. My back-end knowledge includes Express and Node.js. I have strong front end development skills which include extensive work with HTML, CSS and front-end JavaScript. I am also interested in learning human languages, not just programming ones, so I aim to develop applications that can be accessed by users in several languages.
